# ChinookMusicDB
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree Program (egFWD initiative).

In this project, the database of a hypothetical music store called "Chinook" is queried with SQLite to understand its media, customers, employees, and revenues. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Chinook Database has been provided in 'chinook-erd.pdf', and the database is the file 'chinook.db'.

Four questions were asked of the data:

1) Who is the Sales Support Agent of the Year?
2) Which file formats are the most popular ?
3) What are the top 5 trending albums in the last year?
4) What are the top 5 trending songs of the highest-selling composer?

A single .sql file containing the SQL query to be run in an SQLite environment has been provided to help answer each question, except for question 2 for which there are 2 sql files (it was answered more deeply with two slightly different queries).

The returned records have been imported into MS Excel to create visualizations that answer each of the four questions above. Those visualizations are provided in the file 'Presentation.pdf'
